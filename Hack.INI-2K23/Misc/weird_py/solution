After taking a look at this Python code, we can notice that it prompts the user to input two numbers 'a' and 'b'. The program also checks whether 'a' and 'b' are instances of an int or a float, and an error is raised if they are not. After that, the program checks whether a/b is an integer and whether a%b is not equal to 0. There is no combination of two numbers that can bypass this if condition, so I looked for a bug in the is_integer() method. I found that there's a problem in representing large floating numbers in Python. The weird thing I found is that if I give is_integer() a large floating number like 1e23, it returns TRUE! So we found the perfect 'a'. Now, what's the number that is not divisible by 1e23? After trying four numbers in a row, I found that 'b' is 5 in our case. And here we go, we bypassed the if statement and got the flag.
