## Part one 

-Taking a look of the challenge elf file
```
└─$ file chall 
chall: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=936f4793b33e83540cb42b65e16fb1bae14ed732, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped

-Lets open it with ghidra now

## Part two

-This is the code that is generated by ghidra

-We can see that the key is checked in check_key() , lets have a look at it 
![App Screenshot](https://via.placeholder.com/468x300?text=App+Screenshot+Here)
It can be noticed that the length of the key should be 0x18 which is 24 , and the key is checked in 5 functions , lets have a look at them 

### check_part1() function 
![App Screenshot](https://via.placeholder.com/468x300?text=App+Screenshot+Here)

This function will return 0 (which is the value we want) only if 

- the first 3 charachters of the key are numerical
- this 3 numbers should be less than 366
- the program will return the negation of int_key < 1 so the int_key should be greater than 1 (int_key represents the first 3 numbers of the key)

### check_part2() function 
![App Screenshot](https://via.placeholder.com/468x300?text=App+Screenshot+Here)

This function will return 0 (which is the value we want) only if 

- the next 2 charachters of the key are numerical
- this 2 numbers should be less than 95
- the program will return the negation of int_key > 3 so the int_key should be less than 3 (int_key represents the next 2 numbers of the key)

### check_part3() function 
![App Screenshot](https://via.placeholder.com/468x300?text=App+Screenshot+Here)

This function will return 0 (which is the value we want) only if 

- the next 5 charachters of the key should be "-MUH-"

### check_part4() function 
![App Screenshot](https://via.placeholder.com/468x300?text=App+Screenshot+Here)

This function will return 0 (which is the value we want) only if 

- the next 7 charachters of the key are numerical
- the program will return the negation of what degits_sum() returns , degits_sum() returns the sum of the lower 32bits of int_key by ANDing it with 0xffffffff 
- In summary, the code in line 8 and 9 calculates a checksum of the lower 32 bits of int_key by summing its digits, and then returns either 0 or -1 depending on whether the checksum is a multiple of 7 or not.

### check_part5() function 
![App Screenshot](https://via.placeholder.com/468x300?text=App+Screenshot+Here)

This function will return 0 (which is the value we want) only if 

- the next charachter should be "-"  (line 13)
- the next 6 charchters should be numerical and dont equal to 0 (line 14,line 15)
